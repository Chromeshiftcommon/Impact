<h3>Slub Fabrics</h3><br>
<br><br>
An incomplete, imperfect fabric with a special effect. The slub! A slub fabric can be recognised by its asymmetric, uneven yarns. This yarn type belongs to the fancy yarns group. Fancy yarns have a surface structure that deviates or colours that deviate from standard yarns.   How are slub yarns produced? Slub yarns are created by changing the speed of the base rollers on the spinning frame, which produces threads with thicker sections in different places. In the 19th century, yarn was still spun by hand. Therefore, it was more common to have yarns of differing thickness. The introduction of....

<h3>Colour groups</h3>
<br>
At Tootal, our fabrics are divided into 5 colour groups ranging from light to dark: white, pastel, medium, dark and extra dark. This classification is based on the way the fabrics are dyed. There are different methods for dyeing fabrics; it can be done at any time during the process. Textiles can be dyed as fibres, yarns, cloth or as the completed garment. Tootal supplies fabrics that are coloured by means of yarn dyeing, piece dyeing and printing. In piece dyeing, the cloth is woven in a neutral colour. Only after weaving is it dyed the desired colour. This procedure....

<h3>20 years fashionable yarn-dyed fabrics at Tootal</h3>
<br>
Yarn-dyed fabric is made of yarns that are being dyed before the weaving process takes place. This is why we refer to them as “yarn-dyed fabrics.” Over the years Tootal’s collection of yarn-dyed shirt fabrics has evolved and has expanded considerably. At the start of the 70’s Tootal still had only a limited number of classic yarn-dye designs in its collection. Soon after, we decided to increase the number of classic dress shirt designs made from yarn-dyed fabrics in the standard collection and have been extending this range of fabrics yearly. Consequently we made them part of our NOS (never....

<h3>Blouses or shirts?</h3>
<br>
Blouses or shirts? Is there any difference between a blouse and a shirt? Well, yes! Blouses are used by women and shirts by men. That distinction first arose in the 13th and 14th century. During those days women were dressed by chamber maids. Since the maids buttoned the blouses, it was easier for them to have the buttons on the left-hand front side. The gentlemen, however, much preferred to button their shirts themselves with their right hand. Consequently, the buttons are placed differently. A blouse has its button on the right-hand front side, whereas a shirt has its button on....

What would the world be without colour? Colours make life much brighter. Without colour everything we see becomes a dull display of shapes. However, colour can also make life slightly more complicated; consider colour blindness and the confusion that can arise from the subjectivity of colours. The company Pantone must have been thinking the same when they released their first colour coding version in 1963. These PMS (Pantone Matching System) codes are recorded and are the starting point for all parties involved in design and production with colours.

Historically, Enschede has been a city of textiles. Enschede was originally an agricultural settlement, but working on the land certainly did not make the farmers rich. They started to weave linen to create additional income, the fabrics were sold to itinerant peddlers who sold it for large amounts of money in the west of the Netherlands. As a result of their success, some of the peddlers decided to establish themselves as manufacturers in Enschede and its surroundings, an area better known as Twente, and had the farmers weave for them.

<h3>The history of woven textiles</h3>
<br>
Textile literally means “that which has been woven”. It derives from the Latin word “texere”, which means “to weave”. Textile consists of filaments (endless threads) or fibres (short pieces of thread). Textile raw materials can be divided into natural materials, such as: cotton, linen, wool and silk, and synthetic materials, such as, for example, polyester. To make textile, you need yarns or filaments. Fabric is processed by knitting or weaving, thus creating a cloth. This fabric is made into textile products. The development of spinning and weaving began in ancient Egypt around 3400 B.C. The tool originally used for weaving....

<br><br>

<b>Blue textiles</b><br>
Blue is considered a primary colour and consists of many colour groups, from light to dark. Orange is the complementary colour of blue. Complementary colours usually go well together and complement one another. It is also for this reason that you often see this colour combination in textiles.
<br><br>

<b>Respectable and safe</b><br>
Blue is the most universal of colours and is therefore an attractive option when you are struggling to make a choice. From a psychological perspective, blue makes a respectable impression. The colour is considered reliable, responsible, conservative, predictable and safe. If this is the impression you wish to convey, then blue is the perfect choice for textiles!
<br><br>

<b>Classic and fashion collections</b><br>
Consumers are fervent wearers of the colour blue. In addition to jeans, shirts, blouses and jackets are popular garments in blue. The most popular blue fabrics are very diverse; from even colours and prints to checks and stripes, in different shades of blue and in different colour combinations, in cotton and polyester cotton blends – the possibilities are endless.
<br><br>

<b>Corporate textiles and workwear</b><br>
Blue shades feature widely in the corporate world. The various popular fabrics are comparable with the consumer fabrics. Extra-strong and water repellent fabrics are more popular in some sectors. You can find a comprehensive choice of these fabrics in the Tootal collection.

<p>In slub fabrics, the threads are thicker in places. This produces a special effect when you weave a fabric out of these yarns. Initially, yarns of uneven thickness were regarded as damaged or of poor quality. Later, the use of slub yarns in linen look-a-like fabrics became a trend. Initially, slub yarns were only available in natural fabrics such as cotton, linen and wool. The modern machines used nowadays can create a slub effect with synthetic yarns to give it a more natural look.</p>

<p><p>At Tootal, our fabrics are divided into 5 colour groups ranging from light to dark: white, pastel, medium, dark and extra dark.</p>
<p>This classification is based on the way the fabrics are dyed. There are different methods for dyeing fabrics; it can be done at any time during the process. Textiles can be dyed as fibres, yarns, cloth or as the completed garment. Tootal supplies fabrics that are coloured by means of yarn dyeing, piece dyeing and printing.</p>
<p>In piece dyeing, the cloth is woven in a neutral colour. Only after weaving is it dyed the desired colour. This procedure is widely used for popeline / plain weave cloth.</p>
<p>In yarn dyeing, the cloth is woven in coloured yarns. This means the fabric is already the desired colour when it comes off the loom. This method of dyeing is commonly used for dobbies and, of course, for multi-colour designs.</p>
<p>The difference between these two types of fabric is reflected in the price. Yarn-dyed fabrics have the same price for all colours, while piece-dyed fabrics are composed of divided colour groups. These codes can also be found on our colour cards as suffixes behind the colour numbers. The darker the colour, the more expensive the fabric.</p>
<p>Sometimes colours that do not appear dark at first glance may still fall into the “dark” colour group. For example, canary yellow, bright green or fire red. However, these colours require a relatively large volume of colouring dyes to create the right shade, sometimes just as much as dark blue or black.</p>

<p>Plant-based raw materials, such as cotton, smell like burnt paper when they burn. The thread ignites and burns quickly. The ash that is produced is soft. With a blend, such as Polyester Cotton, you will observe a sooty flame. The ash is partly hard and partly soft.</p>
<p>Raw materials that are entirely synthetic, like polyamide and polyester, produce hard ash. Polyamide produces a pungent smell and the flame melts the fibres. The flame is non-sooty. Polyamide raw materials are practically always in filament form (fabric made of synthetic yarn). On burning polyester, you observe a sooty cloud and hard residual ash. These raw materials are seen in blends, in the form of fibres, and sometimes in filament form.</p>
<p><strong><u>How does the wet strength test work?</u></strong></p>
<p>Another way of identifying the characteristics of the fabric is by means of a wet strength test. You hold a thread of the fabric between the thumbs and forefingers of both hands. Drip water onto the centre of the thread using a pipette. Then, try to pull the thread apart and see where it breaks. If the fabric contains only cotton, it will be stronger when wet than when dry. Synthetic fabrics are equally strong whether wet or dry.</p>

<div class="newstitle">From field to fabric to shirt</strong></div><br>
<p>Shirts, shorts, jeans, vests, T-shirts, hot pants, dresses, you name it. We regard it as completely normal to buy and wear ready-made clothes online or in-store whenever we please. We can hardly remember it being any different. Particularly since online web shops changed our shopping habits completely. Despite the fact that these online platforms and technological developments have made everything quicker and easier by bringing clothing within arms’ reach, the fundamental process of field to fabric and fabric to shirt remains the same.</p>
<p><strong>This is how it starts….</strong></p>
<p>Cotton plantations are found primarily in hot countries, because the cotton plant (Gossypion) requires plenty of heat and water. After several months, you have a field of fully-grown cotton plants. The seeds of the cotton plant eventually develop into the familiar fluffy balls of cotton. The cotton is then picked, either by hand or machine. This machine separates the cotton fibres from the cotton seeds. The cotton fibres are used to produce cotton fabric. The seeds of the cotton plant are then sown again, or used to make cottonseed oil.</p>
<p><strong>Spinning</strong></p>
<p>The cotton is spun into a workable material. Spinning is the first step in textile production. The cotton is developed into workable yarn. The structure of the yarn is determined during this process. It may be constructed entirely of cotton, or combined with synthetic fibres. Synthetic fibres are manufactured by means of a chemical process. Spinning takes place on a machine that twists the fibres together. Therefore, this process is also known as spinning yarn. The structure of the fibres determines what spinning method is used. Spinning of yarn takes place in a spinning mill. The mechanism of a spinning machine is the same as when done by hand, only it is far quicker and more efficient in terms of production.</p>
<p><strong>Plying and twisting of cotton</strong></p>
<p>Often, spun yarns are too thin or weak, so two single threads are twisted together. This process is known as “plying”. The plied yarns then form the foundation of the fabric. The threads can be twisted together in different ways. The method of twisting determines the structure of the yarn, as well as the finish when the yarn is spun into cloth. In addition, there is a difference between carded and combed cotton (and/or wool). Carded cotton/wool has a fluffier look and is coarse to the touch. Combed cotton is softer and more compact, with a smoother finish.</p>
<p><strong>Weaving fabrics </strong></p>
<p>Different methods of weaving produce entirely different fabrics, despite being made from the same material. The structure and method of spinning also play a role in this.<br/>
Fabrics are woven on looms nowadays. A number of yarns are drawn at right angles to one another on the loom, the warp. Yarns are then threaded horizontally through the warp, the weft. This mechanical method enables high speed weaving and the ability to produce a broader weaving width. Different types of fabric are produced by using different weaving techniques to combine the warp and weft to create a fabric.</p>
<p><strong>Dyeing, printing and finishing</strong></p>
<p>After the yarn has been woven into fabric, you have the basic fabric. This can then be treated by dyeing it and applying a finishing layer, or designs can be applied with printing techniques. Cloth dyeing involves the use of equipment such as a jigger, reel, jet or nozzle dying machine, or the product is dyed in a tumbler (a sort of spin dryer) of which the drum turns with the cloth in the dye bath. The cloth is submerged in the dye bath using different techniques. Time and temperature are important elements of the dyeing process.</p>
<p><strong>From fabric to shirt </strong></p>
<p>This completes the field to fabric process. Buyers consider various aspects when procuring cloth. Tailors are particularly interested in the quality of the yarn, because that determines the quality of the fabric. The weaving technique (type of fabric), structure of the yarn, weight and colour also play an important role. Different fabrics can be used to produce various end products. This may also determine the preference for a particular type of fabric. Having selected, in this case, shirt fabric, a pattern is selected. The fabric is cut according to the pattern and sewn into a shirt. The production of shirts may take place in large factories, or they may be made-to-measure by hand.</p>
<p>Tootal fabrics offers an endless choice of quality fabrics for various end products. Which is your favourite?</p>

In approximately 3,000 BC, the Greek historian Herodotus wrote the following about cotton from India: <em>&#8220;They have trees growing in the wild, which produce a kind of wool better than sheep’s wool in beauty and quality.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong><u>How is cotton fabric produced?</u></strong></p>
<p>Cotton is an annual plant that can grow approximately 3 metres in height. Cotton plants like a warm and moist climate; a frost-free period of at least 6 months and around 900 mm water per season, which equates to 2.6% of global water consumption. After the plants bloom, pods appear and these burst open after 8 weeks. These produce the cotton. Each plant can produce an average of 100 cotton bolls.</p>
<p>Before harvesting, the cotton fields are defoliated as far as possible to minimise pollution. These days, harvesting is generally carried out with the use of enormous picking machines. The picked cotton is compressed into huge bales, after which the fluff and short fibres are removed in the cotton factory. Then, the cotton is washed and combed. The fibres that are produced in this way go to cotton mills where they are spun into thread. This thread is processed into textiles through weaving or knitting. The average fibre length (staple length) of cotton varies from 10 to 50 mm. This is dependent on the type and origin of the cotton. The longest cotton threads are the most suitable for fine, smooth cotton threads and are relatively expensive.</p>
<p>China is the largest cotton producer in the world, producing 25.5 million bales a year. China is followed by the United States (17.6 million bales) and India (12.5 million bales). Together, this accounts for approximately 60% of total global cotton production. In addition, Australia, Egypt, Brazil and Peru are large suppliers.</p>
<p><strong><u>What goes into a cotton shirt?</u></strong></p>
<p>A single cotton shirt consists of about 240 gr of cotton fibre. To produce this, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>35 m² cotton field;</li>
<li>1270 litres water;</li>
<li>57 gr fertiliser;</li>
<li>100 gr pesticides.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the introduction of synthetic fibres, cotton still accounts for a 50% market share of total textile consumption. The many advantages of cotton undoubtedly play a part in this, for example: it spins very well, it dyes well, it washes well (despite being prone to creasing and shrinkage), it is strong and durable, it is moisture-absorbent and it feels comfortable on the skin.</p>

<div class="newstitle">20 years fashionable yarn-dyed fabrics at Tootal</div><br>
<p>Yarn-dyed fabric is made of yarns that are being dyed before the weaving process takes place. This is why we refer to them as &#8220;yarn-dyed fabrics.&#8221; Over the years Tootal&#8217;s collection of yarn-dyed shirt fabrics has evolved and has expanded considerably. At the start of the 70’s Tootal still had only a limited number of classic yarn-dye designs in its collection. Soon after, we decided to increase the number of classic dress shirt designs made from yarn-dyed fabrics in the standard collection and have been extending this range of fabrics yearly. Consequently we made them part of our NOS (never out of stock) program. Tootal Fabrics has thus become one of the largest suppliers in the market of such fabrics and we have them available on demand. Apart from that we also started developing seasonal collections (Autumn-Winter and Spring-Summer) with our Italian designers as well as so-called &#8220;in between collections&#8221; in yarn-dyed fabrics. These collections have become an important part of our total range of fabrics. They consist of a variety of compositions; cotton, blends (cotton/polyester, polyester/cotton and cotton stretch). The stock of approximately 10 million meters at our warehouse in Enschede, therefore exists for a significant part of yarn-dyed fabrics in a wide variety of compositions, constructions and designs.</p>

<p>In addition to the extensive collection of woven’s shirting fabrics it is logical next step for Tootal to include in their collection of articles woven interlinings (fuseable).</p>
<p>Our broadly based client group demands it as with every order for shirt fabric, interlining will be needed. From a service standpoint it&#8217;s ideal to have one source for both fabric for the garment and the interlining (fuseable). Tootal&#8217;s TOPFUSE range is produced in one of the best locations in Asia with European technology and European management. Heat applied fusible interlining or stickable interlining, provides the additional body to the fabric to enhance the shape and cut to the model of the shirt or blouse. Shirt interlining strengthens the collar, cuff and button tab , and can be used in frontplaket or sleeve head.</p>
<p>Interlining is often invisibly incorporated into the shirt or blouse, but it is essential for the quality and fit. It is a critical and very important part of all tailored shirts and blouses. TOPFUSE Interlining has an adhesive coating and is connected with the upper fabric loop by press/splice press. This perfect connection is established with the precise temperature, time and pressure. The TOPFUSE Tootal shirt interlining fabrics guarantee the wearer a high quality garment that even after regularly use, repeated washes and maintenance it retains its shape. Our 100% cotton interlinings are available in three different weight classes 100 gram, 140 gram and 170 gram and a range of colours they are coated with a polyethylene coating which bonds to the fabrics under the correct conditions.

$lang['BLOUSES'] = '
<div class="newstitle">Blouses or shirts?</div><br>
<p>Blouses or shirts? Is there any difference between a blouse and a shirt? Well, yes! Blouses are used by women and shirts by men. That distinction first arose in the 13th and 14th century. During those days women were dressed by chamber maids. Since the maids buttoned the blouses, it was easier for them to have the buttons on the left-hand front side. The gentlemen, however, much preferred to button their shirts themselves with their right hand. Consequently, the buttons are placed differently. A blouse has its button on the right-hand front side, whereas a shirt has its button on the left-hand front side.  Shirts have been very popular with men for a long time. It used to be rich businessmen who wore them, but nowadays men wear their shirts on the job, at official ceremonies and in their free time. So in that respect we distinguish the dress shirt and casual- or smart casual shirts either as regular or slim fit.</p>
<p>The blouse’s story is another tale. It wasn’t until the 19th century that blouses were worn regularly by women. It was usually combined with a long skirt, and most of the blouses had long sleeves and a high collar. Nowadays both blouses and shirts are available in a broad range of sleeve lengths, collars and colours. Tootal fabrics is the perfect supplier for a wide array of fabrics for a shirt or blouse that fits you perfectly. Whatever fabric composition, weave, finish, colour, printed with or without stretch the client is looking for we most probably have it.</p>

<p><p>What would the world be without colour? Colours make life much brighter. Without colour everything we see becomes a dull display of shapes. However, colour can also make life slightly more complicated; consider colour blindness and the confusion that can arise from the subjectivity of colours.</p>
<p>The company Pantone must have been thinking the same when they released their first colour coding version in 1963. These PMS (Pantone Matching System) codes are recorded and are the starting point for all parties involved in design and production with colours. The objective of this &#8220;Matching System&#8221; is the reproduction of a specific colour. Initially, this system was mainly used in the graphic world, but by now the catalogue has been expanded to include many other fields, including textiles. The huge number of different colours in the textile industry has increased tremendously over the years, which is why the textile industry uses special colour guide: TC = Textile Cotton and TP = Textile Paper. Through this system Pantone has made design, access and reproduction of colours in the textile industry significantly easier.</p>

$lang['TEXTILES'] = '
<div class="newstitle">Enschede City of Textiles</div>
<p><p>Historically, Enschede has been a city of textiles. Enschede was originally an agricultural settlement, but working on the land certainly did not make the farmers rich. They started to weave linen to create additional income, the fabrics were sold to itinerant peddlers who sold it for large amounts of money in the west of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>As a result of their success, some of the peddlers decided to establish themselves as manufacturers in Enschede and its surroundings, an area better known as Twente, and had the farmers weave for them. The yarns were delivered to the homes of the farmers and were woven into fabrics in small weaving rooms at their home. In the early 18th century no less than 40% of the workforce in Twente was employed in the textile industry.</p>
<p>The textile industry flourished, especially when Napoleon ensured that textiles from England could no longer reach mainland Europe. When Belgium, which also had a thriving textile industry, separated from the Netherlands, the Dutch government decided to give the industry in Twente a significant boost. The first steam engine arrived in Twente (1830). That was a first step towards the industrialisation of the home industry. Factories were opened, steam engines and bleaching facilities were set up and textile schools were established. Moreover, around 1860 Enschede was connected to the railway network.</p>
<p>When in 1862 a devastating fire in the centre of Enschede destroyed most of the factories, churches and schools, the opportunity arose for the industry to spread its wings. New factories were constructed and urban farms were replaced with stately mansions. The textile barons built residential areas for their workers and had parks designed for the population. In addition, hospitals, museums and other institutions were built and established.</p>
<p>As the factories grew, the relationship between the workers and textile barons cooled. Wages were low, working hours long and the living and working conditions were poor. Towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century this resulted in many strikes. The situation did not improve during the First World War and during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Somewhat later, the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War left many factories seriously damaged.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the textile barons enthusiastically started rebuilding the city and their factories, they failed to modernise. By now, the textile industry had become a global industry and there was overproduction. Because of this surplus production and increased labour costs in the Netherlands, the Enschede factories could no longer compete with low-wage countries. One by one the large factories of yesteryear closed their doors in the 1950s and 60s and employment in the textile industry decreased.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that textile manufacturing has largely left Enschede, the knowledge relating to textiles has not disappeared. The (only) Technical Textile College of the Netherlands is located in Enschede and many companies in Twente continue to be successful in textiles, either through trading, design or production of textiles in niche markets.</p>
<p>So, the fact that Tootal fabrics is located in Enschede is not entirely coincidental. Tootal is a classic example of a textile company that has put itself on the map through innovation, by finding the right formula. For more than 40 years, Tootal has been successfully trading in textiles and hopes to continue to do so for decades to come.</p>

$lang['WOVEN'] = '
<div class="newstitle">The history of woven textiles</div>
<p><p>Textile literally means &#8220;that which has been woven&#8221;. It derives from the Latin word &#8220;texere&#8221;, which means &#8220;to weave&#8221;. Textile consists of filaments (endless threads) or fibres (short pieces of thread). Textile raw materials can be divided into natural materials, such as: cotton, linen, wool and silk, and synthetic materials, such as, for example, polyester. To make textile, you need yarns or filaments. Fabric is processed by knitting or weaving, thus creating a cloth. This fabric is made into textile products.</p>
<p>The development of spinning and weaving began in ancient Egypt around 3400 B.C. The tool originally used for weaving was the loom. From 2600 B.C. onwards, silk was spun and woven into silk in China. Later in Roman times the European population was clothed in wool, leather and linen. Textile was a product of home industry. People produce textile to meet their own needs. Once production exceeded their own needs, the textiles were traded for other goods.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages broadcloth became popular and the broadcloth industry clustered in particular in northern France, Flanders and Holland. Broadcloth was wear-free, water and soil release, and long-lasting whilst requiring little care. The production of broadcloth was first industrialised in Leiden. A transition took place from working at home to market-oriented production and mechanisation. Inventions like the flying shuttle and the spinning machine made cheap mass production possible in the UK.</p>
<p>Around 1780 textile could be produced more cheaply and in much larger quantities thanks to the mechanically driven loom (steam engine). This was necessary because the population was growing exponentially. During the Industrial Revolution various technological inventions led to a different role for the worker in the process. The weaving process turned into a processing industry.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century the first synthetic fibres were made and the discovery of nylon and later, for example, polyester followed in the 20<sup>th </sup>century.</p>
<p>These days synthetic fibres are still being invented. Nevertheless, the large majority of textile products continue to be made from natural materials. The cotton shirt has become an indispensable feature in the urban landscape.</p>

$lang['IRON'] = '
<div class="newstitle">How to iron a shirt in 3 minutes</div><br>
<p>Many people dislike ironing. Because despite a good iron and a good ironing board, certain actions still need to be performed. Follow the instructions below and iron a shirt wrinkle-free in no time.</p>
<p>1.Before you begin, check the label on the shirt, it is there for a reason. The information on the label of the shirt tells you how to iron a shirt (fabric). Please beware that some fabrics should not be ironed because they can not stand the heat of the iron. To maintain your shirt for a long time, we recommend ironing the shirts inside out.</p>
<p>2. Start with ironing the sleeves. Hold the shirt at the shoulders and place it with the back facing upwards on the ironing board. Pull it taut, put the sleeve on the board and first smooth it out using your hand. First, iron the back of the sleeve. Start ironing at the seam of the shoulder in a downwards direction towards the end of the sleeve. Make sure the fabric remains taut on the ironing board.</p>
<p>3. Next, iron the front of the sleeve. Turn the shirt over and pull it taut at the shoulders. Then, place it on the ironing board. Put the sleeve down and again start ironing outwards from the seam of the shoulder towards the end of the sleeve. Do not iron a crease in the sleeve, since you are ironing the shirt inside out. Next, iron the cuff. Start on the inside and then iron the front (outside). Make sure not to iron a crease in your cuff! Repeat step two and three for the other sleeve.</p>
<p>4. Iron the torso area. Hold the right front at the collar and at the end of the right front. Pull the right front with the side seam along the board, over the top of the ironing board. Then iron the right front and repeat this for the left front.</p>
<p>5. Place the right shoulder of the shirt on the tip of the ironing board. Iron the front and the back of the shoulder. Repeat this step for the left shoulder.</p>
<p>6. Ironing the back of the shirt. First pull the right front of the shirt with the back facing upwards over the ironing board Iron the right back from the top downwards. Repeat this step for the left back.</p>
<p>7. Now iron the front placket along the buttons. Iron from the collar to the bottom of the shirt. Repeat this for the left front of the shirt.</p>
<p>8. Finally, iron the collar. Place the inside of the collar on the ironing board and then iron the collar. Turn the shirt over and then iron the outside of the collar. Do not press too hard, as this will create creases.</p>
<p>Nearly done&#8230;Carefully put the shirt on a coat hanger, making sure that no new creases are formed. Is ironing still an obstacle for you? In that case, there are always the Tootal easy-care fabrics.</p>
