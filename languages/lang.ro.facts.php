<h3>Two fold collection</h3>
Let’s twist! Two fold refers to the yarn used in weaving the fabric, because two yarns are combined and twisted to form the thread. There are two methods to twist the yarns; clockwise and anti-clockwise. The clockwise direction, also called Z-twist and the anti-clockwise method, is called S-twist. The direction of the yarn and twill ensures the finished material is softer than fabrics created with a corresponding yarn and twill weave. By twisting two or more yarns, the fabric will be much stronger. Take a look into our wide range of Tootal two fold fabrics in different compositions, constructions and colours.
