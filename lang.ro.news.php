<h3>Slub Fabrics</h3><br>
<br><br>
An incomplete, imperfect fabric with a special effect. The slub! A slub fabric can be recognised by its asymmetric, uneven yarns. This yarn type belongs to the fancy yarns group. Fancy yarns have a surface structure that deviates or colours that deviate from standard yarns.   How are slub yarns produced? Slub yarns are created by changing the speed of the base rollers on the spinning frame, which produces threads with thicker sections in different places. In the 19th century, yarn was still spun by hand. Therefore, it was more common to have yarns of differing thickness. The introduction of....

<h3>Identify the raw material by means of a burn test or wet strength test</h3>
<br>
There are different methods for identifying the characteristics of fabric. It can be done by means of a burn test and a wet strength test. How does the burn test work? You take a thread of the fabric and set it alight with a lighter or match, for example; Then, observe the way it burns and identify the resulting odour. Plant-based raw materials, such as cotton, smell like burnt paper when they burn. The thread ignites and burns quickly. The ash that is produced is soft. With a blend, such as Polyester Cotton, you will observe a sooty flame. The....

<h3>20 years fashionable yarn-dyed fabrics at Tootal</h3>
<br>
Yarn-dyed fabric is made of yarns that are being dyed before the weaving process takes place. This is why we refer to them as “yarn-dyed fabrics.” Over the years Tootal’s collection of yarn-dyed shirt fabrics has evolved and has expanded considerably. At the start of the 70’s Tootal still had only a limited number of classic yarn-dye designs in its collection. Soon after, we decided to increase the number of classic dress shirt designs made from yarn-dyed fabrics in the standard collection and have been extending this range of fabrics yearly. Consequently we made them part of our NOS (never....

<h3>Blouses or shirts?</h3>
<br>
Blouses or shirts? Is there any difference between a blouse and a shirt? Well, yes! Blouses are used by women and shirts by men. That distinction first arose in the 13th and 14th century. During those days women were dressed by chamber maids. Since the maids buttoned the blouses, it was easier for them to have the buttons on the left-hand front side. The gentlemen, however, much preferred to button their shirts themselves with their right hand. Consequently, the buttons are placed differently. A blouse has its button on the right-hand front side, whereas a shirt has its button on....

<h3>How to be a scholar in colour</h3>
<br>
What would the world be without colour? Colours make life much brighter. Without colour everything we see becomes a dull display of shapes. However, colour can also make life slightly more complicated; consider colour blindness and the confusion that can arise from the subjectivity of colours. The company Pantone must have been thinking the same when they released their first colour coding version in 1963. These PMS (Pantone Matching System) codes are recorded and are the starting point for all parties involved in design and production with colours. The objective of this “Matching System” is the reproduction of a specific....

<h3>Enschede City of Textiles</h3>
<br>
Historically, Enschede has been a city of textiles. Enschede was originally an agricultural settlement, but working on the land certainly did not make the farmers rich. They started to weave linen to create additional income, the fabrics were sold to itinerant peddlers who sold it for large amounts of money in the west of the Netherlands. As a result of their success, some of the peddlers decided to establish themselves as manufacturers in Enschede and its surroundings, an area better known as Twente, and had the farmers weave for them. The yarns were delivered to the homes of the farmers....

<h3>The history of woven textiles</h3>
<br>
Textile literally means “that which has been woven”. It derives from the Latin word “texere”, which means “to weave”. Textile consists of filaments (endless threads) or fibres (short pieces of thread). Textile raw materials can be divided into natural materials, such as: cotton, linen, wool and silk, and synthetic materials, such as, for example, polyester. To make textile, you need yarns or filaments. Fabric is processed by knitting or weaving, thus creating a cloth. This fabric is made into textile products. The development of spinning and weaving began in ancient Egypt around 3400 B.C. The tool originally used for weaving....
